# Convention-over-Git

This project stores a ready-to-use implementation for an idea of [Convention-over-Git](http://blog.it3xl.com/2017/09/convention-over-git.html).

## The Announcement

An update is coming with some some bug fixing.
Also later I will publish an additional project with significant performance considerations.

## How to use

In a terminal (console) navigate to the project's root folder and run the script

`bash run.sh`

**Windows** users have to use Git Bash that comes with any Git installation.

In **sample_repos** folder, you will find prepared (emulated) local and remote repositories with some commits and branches.
Commit somthing or do a merge in any "local repository" and do the Git push.
Then run

`bash run.sh`

again to see changes migrated between remote repositories.

## Use in Production

Go to **repo_settings** folder and create there a file with your syncing repositories' settings.<br/>
Use **sample_repo.sh** file as an example.

Then run

`bash run.sh your_file_for_repo_settings.sh`

Repeat this run when you want to synchronize your remote repositories.

## What is this all about!

Convention over Git is a straightforward approach for an automatic synchronization between Git remote repositories.
Absolutely separate remote repositories will begin behave as a single remote repository.

This approach uses well-known Git tools. It is because Git has an innate ability to do this. All we need to add is some convention.

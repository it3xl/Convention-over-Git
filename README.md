# Convention-over-Git

This project stores a ready-to-use implementation of an idea of Convention-over-Git.

## The Announcement

An update is coming with some some bug fixing.
Also later I will publish an additiona project with significant performance considerations.

## How to use

In a bash console navigate to the project's root folder and run the script<br/>
$ bash **convention-over-git.sh**  your_any_repos_nickname

**Windows** users have to use Git Bash that comes with any Git installation.

In the **sample_repos** folder, you will find prepared (emulated) local and remote repositories.
Commit somthing or do a merge in the "local repositories" and push.
Then run the **convention-over-git.sh** script again to see changes migrated between remote repositories.

## What is this all about!

Convention over Git is a straightforward approach for an automatic synchronization between Git remote repositories.
Absolutely separate remote repositories will begin behave as a single remote repository.

This approach uses well-known Git tools. It is because Git has an innate ability to do this. All we need to add is some convention.
